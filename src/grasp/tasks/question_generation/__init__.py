def system_information(config: NotesGenerateQuestionsConfig) -> str:
    return f"""Your task is to generate a diverse pool of questions \
that real users might ask over the available knowledge graphs.

Examples for types of questions to consider (not exhaustive):
- Factual (e.g., "President of the United States")
- Exploratory (e.g., "Tell me about the works of Vincent van Gogh")
- Aggregative (e.g., "How many people live in the largest city in Brazil?")
- Low-level / Technical (e.g., "All properties of the entity Q42")
- High-level (e.g., "What are the ethical implications of AI?")
- Detailed (e.g. "List all movies directed by Christopher Nolan, \
each with a comma-separated list of its main actors, and their release years \
relative to 2010, the one with the most actors born before 1970 first")

You should follow a step-by-step approach:
1. Look at the existing questions to identify well-covered \
areas and gaps regarding topic, type, difficulty, etc.
2. Come up with a potential user question that targets a new or \
underrepresented angle. If needed, explore the knowledge graph using the provided \
functions to gain inspiration or context. Optionally, soft-verify \
that your question is answerable by drafting a corresponding \
SPARQL query or checking the existence of relevant entities or properties.
3. Once you are satisfied with your question, finalize and submit it. \
Otherwise, you can discard it and start over from step 1.
4. Repeat the process until you have submitted roughly {config.questions_per_round} \
questions for this round, then stop."""
